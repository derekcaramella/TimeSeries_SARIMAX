# TimeSeries_SARIMAX

I analyzed Autocorrelation Functions (ACF) & Partial Autocorrelation Functions (PACF) to determine the ARIMA models' order. Additionally, I conducted necessary differencing to preprocess the data into the stationary assumption. In addition to appraisal processing, I conducted a graph brute force search to identify the best model order with the smallest AIC & BIC metrics. Lastly, I executed a predictive analysis with 95% confidence to forecast the succeeding year's revenue.
